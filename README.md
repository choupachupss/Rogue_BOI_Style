You'll need SFML 2.0  <br />
SFML : http://www.sfml-dev.org/index-fr.php <br />

And you need a compiler that supports C++11 features (Gcc 4.8 and newer, clang 3.3 and newer or visual 2010 and newer).

This version just creates a random layout for a maze and displays it in a mini-map. Shows two characters on screen,
that you can move around with ugly animations.<br /> 

You can compile this project on your plateform, by cloning it, then run "cmake ." and then "make".<br />
You need to install SFML 2.0 on your own, but cmake should be able to detect its presence by itself (so no editing a configuration file for you).<br />
The program executable should be in <the root folder where you cloned>/bin/Kirogame
