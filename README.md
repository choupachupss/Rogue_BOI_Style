You'll need SFML 2.0 and Boost to compile this. <br />
SFML : http://www.sfml-dev.org/index-fr.php <br />
Boost : http://www.boost.org/ 

And you need to support (at least some of) C++11 features.

This version just create a random layout for a maze and display it in a mini-map. <br /> 
Actually working on the game architecture !

You can compile this project on your plateforme, by cloning it, then run "cmake ." and then "make".
The programma executable should be in <the root folder where you cloned>/bin/Kirogame
