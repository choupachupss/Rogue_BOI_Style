You'll need SFML 2.0  <br />
SFML : http://www.sfml-dev.org/index-fr.php <br />

And you need a compiler that support C++11 features (Gcc 4.8 and older, clang 3.3 and older or visual 2010 and older).

This version just create a random layout for a maze and display it in a mini-map. Show two characters on the screen,
that you can move around with ugly animations.<br /> 

You can compile this project on your plateforme, by cloning it, then run "cmake ." and then "make".
You need to install SFML 2.0 on your own, but cmake should be able to detect its presence by itself (so no editing a configuration file for you)
The program executable should be in <the root folder where you cloned>/bin/Kirogame
